/**
 * This layer is interposed between SimpleBuildActor and the two BuildRunnerActor and ExtractorActor.
 * It is used to make sure there are no more than "capacity" requests concurrently sent out at any
 * given time. The point is optimizing CPU utilization; with a simple RoundRobinRouter, messages are divided
 * into multiple queues immediately (one queue per child actor); if one of the children exhausts
 * all of its jobs immediately, one CPU core would remain pointlessly idle. Instead, Controller implements a
 * straightforward semaphore, by which BuildRunnerActors/ExtractorActors will only receive a message when
 * there is an actual core available.
 *
 * Send your requests to the Controller as if you were sending them to the wrapped actor. The wrapped actor
 * will receive from the Controller a Controlled(msg,from) request, where "from" is the original sender; the
 * response, wrapped into a Done(msg,from) where from is the same found in the Controlled(), is to be sent
 * to the sender (aka the Controller), which will unwrap it and return it to the original requester.
