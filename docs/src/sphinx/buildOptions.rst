Build options
====================

.. _section-build-options:

The build options section
-------------------------

Some additional options can modify the behavior of dbuild during the building stage;
these options have an effect on all projects. They are specified in the build "options"
section, which is entirely optional and lives at the same level as the "projects"
sections. Its structure is currently:

.. code-block:: javascript

   build:{
    projects: [...]
    options: {
     "cross-version"  : <cross-version-level>
    }
   }

cross-version
  This option controls the way in which the various sbt-based projects will use the cross-version
  facility, which appends a Scala version suffix to the artifact id. Consider the following two cases.

  1. If a dbuild configuration file includes a project that has a Scala-based dependent project,
     but the dependency is not included, sbt may try to resolve the dependency against an external
     Maven repositories, built with a different version of Scala. This is undesirable during
     the development and testing of a new Scala version, as the aim is to compile all of the
     dependencies against the same new version of Scala. Dbuild, in this case, is able to
     enforce the policy that all the dependencies must use the exact same version of scala:
     compilation will fail with an informative message otherwise.

  2. Conversely, when releasing, it is desirable to preserve the same cross-version policy
     that the various projects normally use. In this case, we can ask dbuild not to adjust
     cross-versioning, so that the published artifacts follow their native publishing scheme.

  This option can therefore control how strict or lax the cross-version suffix should be
  during building, and how sbt will look for alternatives in case of dependencies that
  are not part of the current configuration file.

  The available options are:

  disabled
    This is the default setting, and it will be used if a "build-options" section is not
    specified. The cross-version suffixes are disabled, and each project is published
    using just a single version, which contains a dbuild-specific version suffix
    (unless "set-version" is used).
    The library dependencies that refer to Scala projects that are not included in this build
    configuration, and which have "binary" or "full" CrossVersion, will be adjusted;
    as a result, missing dependent projects will be detected.

  standard
    Each project will compile with its own natural cross-version suffix.
    This setting is necessary when releasing, usually in conjunction with "set-version",
    in order to make sure that the standard suffix is used while publishing.

  full
    Similar to "disabled", except the full Scala version string is used as a
    cross-version suffix while publishing (even for those projects that would normally
    have cross-version disabled). Missing dependent projects will be detected.

  binaryFull
    The sbt projects that publish artifacts using the "Binary" cross-version setting are
    forced to use the full Scala version string in place of a shortened version ("_2.10");
    however, the projects that publish without cross-version will remain unchanged.
    Missing dependent projects will be detected. This option exists mainly for testing,
    and is not intended for regular use.

In practice, you can omit the "build-options" section entirely during normal use, and
just add the following if you are releasing using "set-version":

.. code-block:: javascript

   build-options:{cross-version:standard}
