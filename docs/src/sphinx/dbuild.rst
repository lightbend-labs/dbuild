Using dbuild
============

Using dbuild
------------

The stand-alone ``dbuild`` tool is called by specifying on the command line its build configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ bin/dbuild build-file.dbuild

The build tool will create, if not existing, a ``~/.dbuild`` directory in your home, which stores general
dbuild support files and the local repository cache, and a ``target`` in your current directory, which is
used as a staging area for the current build.

Unless specified otherwise, the end results of the build (artifacts and build information) will be stored
into a local repository in ``~/.dbuild``. It is also possible to use a remote Ivy repository as storage;
that is explained later in the section :doc:`repositories`.

Properties file
---------------

By default, dbuild will use the file ``dbuild.properties`` to retrieve information about its internal
configuration. There is usually no need to touch this file, as it contains defaults that should be
adequate for most projects. However, you can modify this file if you would like to modify the standard
behavior in some way (for instance, relocating the default ``~/.dbuild`` directory, or the location of
the Ivy cache it uses).

One important case, however, is the customization of the resolvers list: you can just change the
``[repositories]`` stanza in this properties file, adding or removing resolvers as needed. The list
specified in this properties file will completely override the normal list of library resolvers,
for all of the projects invoked by dbuild. By specifying here a local Artifactory cache, for instance,
the artifacts resolution can be made considerably faster.

The build configuration file
----------------------------

The central part of the build tool operation revolves around the build configuration file, which describes
in detail which software projects are involved in the build, which version of each should be used, and many
other aspects of the build process.

The build file is written in a JSON format. The file is parsed by using the Typesafe config library,
therefore the syntax of the file can be simplified by using the conventions of that library: double
quotes and commas may be omitted, variable substitution is available, and other facilities are
available. You should check the many options that are available to simplify the syntax of
configuration file; they are all documented on the website of the
`config library <http://github.com/typesafehub/config>`_. In addition, dbuild has one special
feature concerning lists of strings: whenever a list of strings is expected, in the form
``"x":["a","b","c"]``, if you have only one element you can also omit the square brackets altogether.
In accordance with the typesafe config library, you can then usually omit the double quotes
and in the end just write ``x:a``.

The order of items in the configuration file is never relevant, unless explicitly mentioned
in the documentation. The top level of the configuration file is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "build"  : <build_section>,
    "options": <options_section>
   }

build
  This section is required, and contains all of the information needed to generate the build.
  It includes the description of the various projects, and other options that control the
  generation of the code. It is described in detail below.

options
  This section is optional. It does not contain information that affect the build, but is used
  to control other aspects of dbuild, in particular options and tasks that should be executed
  after the build. At this time, the section may contain the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "deploy"        : [ <deploy_1>, <deploy_2>,...],
    "notifications" : <notifications>
   }

The two values are optional, and are described in detail on the
pages :doc:`deploy` and :doc:`notifications`, respectively.

The build section
-----------------

The build section has the following content:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "projects": [ <dbuild_project1>, <dbuild_project2>,...],
    "options" : <build-options>
   }

projects
  The "projects" section is the most important one, and is the only one that is required in a
  dbuild configuration file. If you have no other sections, you can take advantage of the
  extended JSON syntax, and introduce the project section directly by writing:
  ``build.projects: [...]``. The list of projects, enclosed in square brackets, describes
  the various software projects that should be built together by dbuild. 

options
  This section contains global options that affect the projects in the build; it is distinct
  from the previous one. It is optional, and is described on the page :doc:`buildOptions`.


Each project descriptions has this structure:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "name"        : <project-name>,
    "system"      : <build-system>,
    "uri"         : <source-repository-uri>,
    "set-version" : <optional-output-version>
    "extra"       : <optional-extra-build-parameters>
   }

Within a project description:

name
  A string identifying the software project. This can be arbitrary, and is only used within dbuild,
  although you will want to use something meaningful, like "akka" for Akka, or "scala-arm" for the
  Scala ARM project.

system
  A string that describes the build system used by this software project. Valid values are currently
  "scala" (custom for the Scala project), "sbt", and "ivy"; additional mechanisms will be added soon (Maven
  support is in the works). If not specified, "sbt" is assumed.

uri
  A string pointing to the source repository for this project. It can be git-based (if the uri begins
  with ``git://`` or ends with ``.git``), or svn (schemes ``http://``, ``https://``, ``svn://``, only
  if an svn repository is detected). Other source repository formats may be added in the future.

  The uri may optionally be prefixed with a ``'#'`` and either a commit hash, an svn version, or a
  branch name. For example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     "uri":  "git://github.com/scala/scala.git#2.10.x"

  dbuild will download and extract the most recent available version in the specified branch, or the
  exact version or commit in case if specified . If no prefix is added, dbuild will fetch the most recent
  version in git master, or svn head.

set-version
  This component is optional, and normally not used. During compilation, dbuild will automatically
  generate a version string that is used for the various artifacts that are produced by each
  project. However, in case you need to obtain artifacts with a specific version string, you can
  override the default value by specifying a specific version string here. If you are planning to
  use this feature in order to release artifact, then you also need to set the option "cross-version"
  to "standard", as explained in the section :ref:`section-build-options`.

extra
  The "extra" component is optional, as are all of its sub-components; it describes additional
  parameters used while building the project, and its content depends on the build system, as
  detailed below.

sbt-specific options
--------------------

In this case the "extra" argument is a record with the following content:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "sbt-version"    : <sbt-version>,
    "projects"       : [ subproj1, subproj2,... ]
    "exclude"        : [ subproj1, subproj2,... ]
    "run-tests"      : <run-tests>
    "options"        : [ opt1, opt2,... ]
    "commands"       : [ cmd1, cmd2,... ]
   }

Each of these fields is optional; their meaning is:

sbt-version
  A string that specifies the version of sbt that should be used to compile
  this dbuild project. If not specified, the sbt version in use will be the
  one specified in the global build options property "sbt-version" (see
  :doc:`buildOptions`). If that is also missing, sbt 0.12.4 will be used.

projects
  A sequence of strings that identifies a subset of the sbt subprojects that should be
  built within this dbuild project. For instance, you can specify:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     "projects":  ["akka-actor"]

  in order to compile only the "akka-actor" sbt project within Akka. For each
  of the specified subprojects, dbuild will also add recursively all of the
  subprojects that are in the same project and that are required dependencies
  of the specified ones; if the subproject is an sbt aggregate, its components
  will also be added. If the "projects" clause is not present, all of the
  subprojects will be included.

  If the project uses sbt's default projects, the actual subproject name may
  vary over time, and take forms like "default-e3c4f7". In order to refer to
  sbt's default subproject, you can use the predefined name `"default-sbt-project"`.

exclude
  Sometimes it may be useful to split a single project into two or more parts.
  This clause can be used to exclude explicitly some of the subprojects, which
  can then be compiled in a different project within the same configuration file,
  using a different project name but using the same uri.

run-tests
  Boolean value: if set to false, the project will be built but no tests will be run.
  Normally, each project is built first, then tested; if compilation succeeds but testing
  fails, the dbuild run will abort and no artifacts will be stored into the repository.
  If you set run-tests to false, however, testing for the affected project will be skipped,
  and the artifacts will be published at the end of the compilation stage. This is useful
  in case you would like to use the artifacts of a given project, even though its testing
  stage is currently failing for whatever reason.

options
  A sequence of strings; they will be
  passed as-is as additional JVM options, while launching the sbt instance that is used
  to build this project.

commands
  A sequence of sbt commands; they will be executed by sbt before dbuild rearranges
  the project dependencies. These commands can be used, for example, to change settings
  using forms like "set setting := ...".

Scala-specific options
----------------------

In the case of Scala, the "extra" record is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "build-target"   : <build-target>,
    "build-options"  : [ opt1, opt2,... ]
    "build-number"   : <build-number>,
    "exclude"        : [ subproj1, subproj2,... ]
   }

Each of the fields is optional. The are:

build-target
  The Scala build system will normally generate the files by invoking
  the target "distpack-maven-opt". If required, a different target can
  be specified using this option.

build-options
  A sequence of strings; they will be appended to the ant options when
  compiling. This option can be used to define additional properties,
  or to set other flags.

build-number
  The contents of the file `build.properties` can be overridden by
  using this option. It is specified as:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
      "major"  : <major>,
      "minor"  : <minor>,
      "patch"  : <patch>,
      "bnum"   : <bnum>,
     }

exclude
  The ant-based Scala build does not support real subprojects. However,
  dbuild will simulate multiple subprojects based on the artifact names.
  This "exclude" clause can be used to prevent some artifacts from being
  published or advertised as available to the rest of the dbuild projects.
  They will still be built, however.

Scala version numbers
---------------------

The handling of version numbers in the Scala build system is made
somewhat more complicated by the variety of ways in which version
strings are passed to ant while compiling Scala. The combination
of `build-number`, `set-version` (described above), and `build-options`,
however, makes it possible to control all the various aspects.
In detail, this is the way in which versions are handled:

maven.version.number
  The first version number is the one that is passed to ant via
  a property called `maven.version.number`. If `set-version` is
  specified, the corresponding string will be used. If there is
  no set-version, the version string will be derived from the
  content of the file `build.number`, in the checked out source
  tree, with an additional build-specific suffix. If there is no
  `build.number`, the Scala build system will use instead
  the version string contained in the file `dbuild.json`, if
  present, with the build-specific suffix. If both `dbuild.json`
  and `build.number` exist, the version in `build.number` will
  be used.

build.number
  The content of the build.number, independently, will also
  affect the calculation of some of the version strings used
  by the Scala ant system. If the extra option `build-option`
  is used, its content will be used to overwrite the content
  of the `build.number` file inside the source tree. This
  replacement will not affect the calculation of `maven.version.number`
  described above.

other properties
  The Scala ant build file uses internally other properties; as
  mentioned previously, they can be set if needed by using the
  option `build-options`. The main option that is probably of
  interest is `build.release`; it can be set using:
  ``build-options:["-Dbuild.release=true"]``

Ivy-specific options
--------------------

The Ivy build system works like a regular build mechanism, but rather than compiling
the needed dependency from a source repository, it asks directly a Maven/Ivy repository
for the requested binary code. Although that rather defeats the point of compiling all
code using the same Scala version, it can nonetheless be quite useful in the case in
which only a specific binary is available, for example in case of libraries that are
proprietary and closed-source, or that are currently unmaintained.

The ``uri`` field follows the syntax "ivy:organization#name;revision". For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    name:   ivytest
    system: ivy
    uri:   "ivy:org.scala-sbt#compiler-interface;0.12.4"
  }

If cross-versions are in use, the Scala version suffix must be explicitly added to the name,
for example: "ivy:org.specs2#specs2_2.10;1.12.3". The "extra" options are the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "main-jar"    : <true-or-false>
    "sources"     : <true-or-false>
    "javadoc"     : <true-or-false>
    "artifacts"   : [ <art1>, <art2>,... ]
    "excludes"    : [ <exclude1>, <exclude2>, .... ]
   }

All the fields are optional. The specification of an artifact is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "classifier"  : <classifier>
    "type"        : <type>
    "ext"         : <extension>
    "configs"     : [<conf1>, <conf2>,... ]>
   }

The option ``main-jar`` controls whether the default binary jar is fetched from the
repository, and it is true by default. The options ``sources`` grabs the source jar, and the
option ``javadoc`` the documentation jar; both options are false by default. The field
``artifact`` can be used to retrieve only specific artifacts from the module.


The four properties of the artifact specification are optional, and map directly to
the components of the Ivy resolution pattern. If no property ``classifier`` is present,
or if it is the empty string, the classifier will remain unspecified. The fields
``type`` and ``ext``, if omitted, will default to the string "jar". The field
``configs`` can optionally be used to specify one or more Ivy configuration; if missing,
the configuration ``default`` will be used. For example, the javadoc jar of a module
can also be obtained by specifying an artifact in which the classifier is
"javadoc", the type is "doc", the file extension is "jar", and the configuration
is "javadoc".

The specification of an exclude is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "organization"  : <groupId>
    "name"          : <name>
   }

Exclusions are used to prevent dependencies in ivy from showing up in the dbuild graph.   This can be used
to break cycles between things you wish to resolve from Ivy and projects which use them.
Specifically, this can be used to resolve an artifact and remove its dependency on a project you are building,
like the scala-xml module and the scala build itself.
